# Sample spaces and events

- **Outcome**: possible result of an experiment.

- **Sample space** (S): set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

- **Event**: any collection (subset) of outcomes contained in the sample space S.

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Example

Toss a fair coin twice. List the sample space and define the event $A$ as "the 
first toss is heads"

- Sample space: $S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$

- Event: $A = \{HH, HT\}$

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Set operations

- The **union** of two events $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cup B$ is the event consisting
  of all outcomes that are either in A, in B, or in both

- The **intersection** of two events $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cap B$ is the 
  consisting of all outcomes in both $A$ and $B$. $A$ and $B$ are **mutually 
  exclusive** if they do not have any outcomes in common.
  
- The **complement** of an event $A$, denoted $A'$, is the set of all outcomes in
  $S$ that are not contained in $A$
  
`r ns(doc_type)`
  
# Probability

- Probability theory is the study of randomness and uncertainty

- Given an experiment and a sample space $S$, want to assign each $A$ the
  number $P(A)$, which is the measure of the chance that $A$ will occur
  
- The assignments $P(\cdot)$ should satisfy axioms that accord with intuitive
  notions of probability

`r ns(doc_type)`
  
## Axioms of probability

1. For any event $A$, $P(A) \ge 0$

2. $P(S) = 1$

3. If $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k$ is a collection of mutually exclusive events, then
   $$P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_k) = \sum_{i=1}^k P(A_i)$$

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Implications

- For the empty set $\emptyset$, $P(\emptyset) = 0$

- For any event $A$: 
    - $0 \le P(A) \le 1$
    - $P(A') = 1 - P(A)$

- For any events $A$ and $B$:
  
$$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$


`r ns(doc_type)`

## Example

Toss a fair coin twice. What is the probability that at least one toss is heads?
First, define relevant events

`r inc(doc_type)`

+ Sample space: $S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$

`r inc(doc_type)`

+ Let $A = \{\text{at least one toss is heads}\} = HH \cup HT \cup TH$

What is $P(A)$?

`r ns(doc_type)`

+ Union: 

$$P(A) = P(HH \cup HT \cup TH) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$$

`r inc(doc_type)`

+ Complement: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
A' &= \{\text{no toss is heads}\} = TT
\\
P(A') &= \frac{1}{4}
\\
P(A) &= 1 - P(A') = \frac{3}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

`r inc(doc_type)`

+ Another:

Let $H_1 = \{\text{heads on first toss}\}$ and $H_2 = \{\text{heads on second toss}\}$

Then $A = \{\text{at least one toss is heads}\} = H_1 \cup H_2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A) &= P(H_1 \cup H_2)
\\
&= P(H_1) + P(H_2) - P(H_1 \cap H_2)
\\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

`r ns(doc_type)`

What is the probability exactly one toss is heads?

$H_1 = \{\text{heads on first toss}\}$ and $H_2 = \{\text{heads on second toss}\}$

$A = \{\text{exactly one toss is heads}\} = (H_1 \cap H_2') \cup (H_1' \cap H_2)$

`r ns(doc_type)`

# Uniform probability

Suppose we have a finite sample space $S$ with $N$ outcomes, integer $N \ge 1$.
Each outcome is equally likely. If there are $m$ outcomes in event $A$, then

$$P(A) = \frac{m}{N}$$

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Example

Roll two fair dice, each outcome in sample space has equal probability $1/36$

$$
\begin{aligned}
S &= \{
\\
& (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), 
\\
& (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), 
\\
& (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), 
\\
& (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), 
\\
& (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), 
\\
& (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) 
\\
& \}
\end{aligned}
$$

What is the probability that the sum of the two faces is 7?

`r inc(doc_type)`

$A = \{\text{sum of the two faces is } 7\} = \{(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)\}$

6 outcomes in $A$, 36 possible outcomes: $P(A) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$

`r ns(doc_type)`

# Counting

Suppose we toss a coin 10 times. 

+ How many outcomes are there?
+ How many would have exactly 4 heads?
+ What is the probability of exactly 4 heads?

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Counting rules

- Rule of sum: if there are $a$ ways to do thing one and $b$ ways to do thing two,
  and you can't do both things, then there are $a+b$ things to do in total

- Rule of product: if there are $a$ ways to do thing one, $b$ ways to do thing two,
  then there are $ab$ ways to do both

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Binomial coefficient

+ **Binomial coefficients** are family of positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem

+ Coefficient of the $x^k$ term in the polynomial expansion of $(1+x)^n$

+ Indexed by two nonnegative integers $n$ and $k$

+ $${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

+ The number of distinct ways of choosing $k$ objects out of $n$

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Example

We toss a coin 10 times

+ How many possible outcomes are there?

`r inc(doc_type)`

$2^{10}$

+ How many of these outcomes have exactly 4 heads?

`r inc(doc_type)`

${10 \choose 4}$

```{r}
choose(n = 10, k = 4)
```

+ What is the probability of exactly 4 heads?

`r inc(doc_type)`

$P(X = 4) = \frac{{10 \choose 4}}{2^{10}} = \frac{210}{1024} = 0.205078125$

`r ns(doc_type)`

# Independence

+ Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if and only if

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$

+ Intuitively, probability of $A$ does not depend on whether or not $B$ occurred,
  and vice versa.
  
+ Many statistical methods assume independence between all pairs of observations in dataset

+ Independence of two events does not imply they are mutually exclusive

+ Examples of dependence:
    - Multiple measurements of same individual over time
    - Measurements located near each other

`r ns(doc_type)`

## NFL example

Are the outcomes of two games independent of one another?

- Suppose previous game was demoralizing loss. Is the team extra motivated 
      for next?
- Suppose the team won previous game, guaranteeing entrance into playoffs. Is
      the team *less* motivated for next?
- Suppose team has won 5 games in a row. Do they have momentum?

`r ns(doc_type)`

# Random variables and distributions

- For a sample space $S$ of some experiment, a **random variable (rv)** is any rule 
  that associates a number with each outcome in $S$. 
  
- Etymology:  
    - called "variable" because different numerical values possible
    - "random" because observed value depends on uncertain experimental outcome
    
- Function that maps from sample space to real numbers: $X: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

- Random variables have probability distributions that specify the probability of
  the rv falling in an interval
  
`r ns(doc_type)`
  
# Why random variables

- Leads to easier math and calculations

- Can define multiple random variables on same probability space
  
- In statistics we usually care about distributions of random variables, not 
  sample space

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Types of random variables

- A random variable is **discrete** if its possible values are from a finite set, 
  or can be listed in an infinite sequence with first, second, etc. elements
  
- A random variable is **continuous** if its possible values are from an entire
  interval of the real line
  
- The random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are **independent and identically
  distributed (iid)** if they are mutually independent and all follow the same 
  distribution

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Probability for discrete random variables

- The **probability mass function (pmf)** of a discrete rv is defined for every 
  number $x$ by
  
  $$f(x) = P(X = x) = P(s \in S: X(s) = x)$$
  $P(X = x)$ is the probability that the rv $X$ assumes the value $x$

- The **cumulative distribution function (cdf)** $F(x)$ of a discrete rv $X$ with
  pmf $f(x)$ is defined for every number $x$ by
  
  $$F(x) = P(X \le x) = \sum_{y: y \le x} f(y)$$
  For any number $x$, $F(x)$ is the probability that the observed value of $X$ 
  will be at most $x$

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Example

Flip a fair coin twice. Derive and plot the pmf and cdf. Let $X$ be the random
variable that equals the number of occurences of heads. The possible values of 
$X$ are $0,1,2$.

`r inc(doc_type)`

- pmf: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X = x) = \begin{cases}
  1/4, & x = 0 \\
  1/2, & x = 1 \\
  1/4, & x = 2 \\
  0, & x \notin \{0, 1, 2\}
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

- cdf: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X \le x) = \begin{cases}
  0, & x < 0 \\
  1/4, & 0 \le x < 1 \\
  3/4, & 1 \le x < 2 \\
  1, & x \ge 2
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

`r ns(doc_type)`

```{r echo = FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
probs <- c(1/4, 1/2, 1/4)
cdf_obs <- c(0, 1, 1, 2)
plot(0:2, probs, ylim = c(0, .5), type = "h", ylab = "PMF", xlab = "X")
plot(ecdf(cdf_obs), ylab = "CDF", xlab = "X", main = "")
```

# The binomial distribution

## Bernoulli distribution

- Consider experiment with single success/failure trial, with probability of
  success $p \in [0, 1]$. The Bernoulli random variable $X$ associated with this
  experiment is 0 if trial is a failure, 1 if it is a success.
  
- pmf of $X$:
  $$
  f(x) = \begin{cases} 
    p^x (1-p)^{1-x} & x \in \{0, 1\}
    \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$  

- $p$ is **parameter** of the distribution, must know to evaluate $f(x)$

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Binomial distribution

- Consider an experiment consisting of $n$ independent Bernoulli trails. The
  binomial random variable $X$ associated with this experiment is defined as the 
  number of successes out of the $n$ trials

- pmf of $X$:
  $$
  f(x) = \begin{cases} 
    {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{1-x} & x \in 0, 1, \ldots, n
    \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

- $n$ and $p$ are parameters of the distribution

- We write $X \sim Binomial(n, p)$

`r ns(doc_type)`

## Example

Suppose we toss a coin 10 times. $X \sim Binomial(10, 0.5)$. What is the 
probability of exactly 4 heads?

`r inc(doc_type)`

$$P(X=4) = f(4) = {10 \choose 4} 0.5^4 0.5^{10-4} = 0.205078125$$

```{r}
dbinom(x = 4, size = 10, prob = .5)
```

`r ns(doc_type)`

## NFL example

- Let X be the number of wins out of a season’s 16 games. If we assume that the 
  outcome of each game is independent of all others, we can say $X \sim Binomial(16, p)$,
  where $p$ is the probability that the Texans win any given game.
  
- Suppose that $p=0.5$. What is the probability the Texans win 9 or more games in a season?

`r inc(doc_type)`

- $P(X \ge 9) = \sum_{x=9}^{16} f(x) = 0.4018097$

```{r eval = FALSE}
sum(dbinom(9:16, 16, .5))
1 - pbinom(q = 8, size = 16, prob = .5)
pbinom(q = 8, size = 16, prob = .5, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

- Would not be unusual at all for an “average” team to win 9 or more games in a season, just by chance.

`r ns(doc_type)`

# Other discrete distributions

- **Discrete uniform distribution**: rv $X$ with integer parameters $a$, $b$, 
  $a \le b$, with pmf:
  $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \quad x = a, a+1, \ldots, b-1, b$$
  
- **Geometric distribution**: rv $X$ with parameter $p>0$, with pmf:
  $$f(x) = (1-p)^xp \quad x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$$
  
  Describes the number of failures required until the first success in a series
  of Bernoulli trials
  
- **Poisson distribution**: rv with parameter $\lambda>0$, with pmf:
  $$ f(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!} \quad x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$$

  Describes counts of events, like number of 911 calls on Friday night
