+ What is Statistics?
+ What do you think of when you hear the word “statistics”?
+ Statistics: The science of collecting, classifying, and interpreting data.
+ Anticipated learning outcomes:
	+ appreciate and apply basic statistical methods **in an everyday life setting**
	+ appreciate and apply basic statistical methods **in their scientific field**


---
#  Where will Statistics be used? 

+ Everyday life – for example
	+ Proper application of general probabilities
	+ How election results are presented
	+ Commercial claims (clinical trials vs. outliers)
+ Applications in the workplace
	+ Google web searches
	+ Netflix user recommendations
	+ Pharmaceutical drug development
	+ Sports analytics
	+ Modeling global climate change
	+ Credit card fraud detection
	+ Biomarkers and disease detection
	+ Criminal justice
	+ Many, many more

+ Collecting data
+ **Observational study** : Observe a group and measure quantities of interest.  This is passive data collection in that one does not attempt to influence the group.  The purpose of the study is to describe the group.
+ **Experiment:** Deliberately impose treatments on groups in order to observe responses.  The purpose is to study whether the treatments cause a change in the responses.


---
#  7 

+ Observational Study Terms
+ **Population:** The entire group of interest
+ **Sample:** A part of the population selected to draw conclusions about the entire population
+ **Census:** A sample that attempts to include the entire population
+ **Parameter:** A concept that describes the population
+ **Statistic:** A number produced from a sample that estimates a population parameter

#  8 

+ Horry County SC, Murder Case
+ Do juries properly represent the racial makeup of Horry County which is 13% African American?
+ 295 jurors summoned, 22 were African American
+ What is the population parameter of interest?
+ What sample statistic could be used to estimate the parameter and does the sample support the claim?


---
#  9 

+ Experiment Terms
+ **Experimental Group:** A collection of experimental units subjected to a difference in treatment, imposed by the experimenter.
+ **Control Group:** A collection of experimental units subjected to the same conditions as those in an experimental group except that no treatment is imposed.
+ This design helps control for potential **confounding** effects.


---
#  10 

+ What are “confounding” effects?
+ When you have multiple factors in a study and you can’t tell which factor causes a change in the variable of interest.
+ Example:  Does going to church make you live longer?.....Not necessarily. There are too many other factors or “lurking variables”, discussed later.
+ Best to set up study with everything else constant and have only one factor changed.  That way, you’re more apt to identify that the change in the variable is due to the change you instituted in the study.


---
#  11 

+ NCTR study (National Center for Toxicological Research)
+ A large scale study was conducted to see if a new drug might have potential toxic effects.  They used rats for the experiment.
+ Dose groups of 0, 100, 200, and 400 ppg were evaluated for liver tumors at the end of a two week exposure to the drug.  (which is the control and which are the experimental groups?)
+ What comparisons would you want to make?
+ Should you evaluate each group on consecutive days at the end of the study?


---
#  12 

+ Working with R
+ R and R Stuido are free software environments for statistical computing and graphics.  I’ll be demonstrating the use of R Studio in this class.
+ R is free and you can download it from https:// rweb.crmda.ku.edu/cran/ .  Once that is downloaded, got to the following site and download R-Studio to run with it; https ://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download / . It acts as a layered program/interface on top of R.
+ There are “R Tutorial” videos through “Lynda”, referenced in the information tab in eCampus. I’ll be demonstrating R Studio and giving you some “canned scripts” to perform various tasks through the semester.  STAT majors need to dig a bit deeper.
+ Suggest copying all datasets to be used (in class and homework) to your working directory in R studio for ease of use.

+ All about variables
+ **Variable:** Any characteristic or quantity to be measured on units in a study
+ **Categorical variable:** Places a unit into one of several categories
	+ Examples: Gender, race, political party
+ **Quantitative variable:** Takes on numerical values for which arithmetic makes sense
	+ Examples: SAT score, number of siblings, cost of textbooks
+ **Univariate** data has one variable.
+ **Bivariate** data has two variables.
+ **Multivariate** data has three or more variables.

+ **Symmetric** data has roughly the same mirror image on each side of a center value.
+ **Skewed** data has one side (either **right** or **left** ) which is much longer than the other relative to the **mode** (peak value).
	+ The above definitions are most useful when describing data with a single mode.
+ **Multimodal** data has more than one mode.
+ Beware of **outliers** when describing shape.
